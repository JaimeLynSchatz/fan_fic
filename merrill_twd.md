	I walked with Batman in the forest and looked for civilization. I had just heard someone on my walkie-talkie, saying they had a camp off the highway. All I could see were trees, trees, and walkers. I killed the walkers and tripped, spraining my ankle.
	After about a mile of forest, I heard footsteps behind me and turned around, holding my gun up. Something grabbed my shoulder and I spun on my heels, coming face to face with a walker. I shot it and it dropped to the ground, dead, pulling me with it. I struggled to get up, but I was stuck. Another walker came from the sound of the gun and tried to get me. I held it back with one hand, pulling the trigger with the other. My gun was empty. 
	“Damnit Batman!” I cursed. I screamed and dropped my gun, using both hands to hold the walker back. It fell on top of me, dead, with a knife through it's skull. A guy hovered over me. He wasn't a walker. He had grey hair and a rifle on his back.
	“Need some help?” He asked, holding out his hand. I grawled out from under the walkers, and he pulled me up.
	“Thanks for saving me.” I said.
	“Of course. Do you have a group to go back to, or something?” He inquired.
	“No. It's just been me and Batman for a while, 6 months, I think, since my mom died. I've been wondering around since then, going place to place. I'm actually looking for someone.” I explained.
	“I'm sorry for your loss. I'm Dale.” He greeted, extending his hand.
	“I'm Summer.” I informed, shaking his hand.
	“Why don't I bring you back to my group? I can also patch up that cut above your right eye.” He suggested. I grazed my hand over my forehead above my eye. Sure enough, I was bleeding. We walked a little and came to a clearing. There were people, a fire, tents, and an RV.
	“Dale, who is she?” A guy questioned, walking up to us.
	“Shane, this is Summer. She was about to get bitten.” Dale introduced.
	“Are you with Batman?” Shane asked me. I nodded. “How old are you?” He followed.
	“12.” I replied.
	“Damn. Well, lucky for you, there are two other 12-year-olds here. Welcome to our group. Don't worry. We'll be like family soon.” He smiled. He walked away. Dale made me sit on a step on the RV and put a Band-aid on my forehead. He also checked my foot. It wasn't sprained, it just hurt. Afterwards, he introduced me to everyone and set up tent for me. Soon enough, it was starting to get dark. I slept in my tent, holding my gun under my pillow, just in case. 
	I woke up and got dressed. I sat against the RV and watched Lori give Carl a haircut. Shane was talking about catching frogs. A loud sound started echoing through the camp, and I jumped up. A red car drove up, alarm blaring. I held my gun up, but Carl lowered my arm as an asian man stepped out.
	“Holy crap! Turn that damn thing off!” Dale ordered. 
	“I don't know how,” the asian guy admitted. 
	“Pop the hood, please. Would you pop the damn hood, please? Pop the damn hood, please!” Shane yelled.
	At the same time, Amy was asking him, “My sister, Andrea. Is she okay? Is she alright? Is she coming back? Is she okay? Did she get out of the city? Is she coming back?”
	“Okay, okay, okay.” The asian guy said, ducking into the car, popping the hood. He stepped out and turned to Amy, “Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's okay.” 
	Jim pulled a plug out of the engine and the car stopped. “Why isn't she with you? Where is she? She is okay?” Amy demanded.
	“Yes. They're fine. Everyone is. Well, Merle not so much.” The asian guy confessed. I didn't know who anyone was talking about.
	“Are you crazy? Driving this wailing bastard up here? Are you trying to attract every walker for miles?” Shane yelled.
	“I think we're okay,” Dale sighed.
	“You call being stupid 'okay'?” Shane retorted.
	“The alarm was echoing all over these hills. Hard to pinpoint the source.” Dale pointed out. Shane turned around and Dale continued talking, glancing at the asian guy, “I'm not arguing. I'm just saying. And it wouldn't hurt to think things through more carefully next time, would it?”
	“Sorry. I got a cool car.” The guy defended. A truck approached and I gripped my gun tighter. A bunch of people stepped out and reunited with the others. I stood close to the RV, watching the scene. I don't think anyone noticed me and Batman.
	“How'd you all get out anyway?” Shane inquired.
	“New guy, he got us out.” The asian guy answered.
	“New guy?” Shane questioned. 
	“Yeah, crazy vato just got into town. Hey, helicopter boy, come say hello.” A spanish guy yelled.
	A guy in a police uniform stepped out. He stared at Shane, Lori, and Carl. Lori and Carl ran over to him. Carl was yelling, “Dad! Dad!” They reunited and I looked around. 
	“So, who are you?” The asian guy asked. I looked at him. He was standing next to me.
	“I'm Summer. Dale saved my life yesterday, and now I'm part of this little set up.” I explained. 
	“I'm Glenn.” He informed. He explained how people were related and filled me in on everything I didn't know. As it got dark, hours later, Dale set up fire. He introduced me to everyone, and I was beginning to feel accepted. We sat in a circle around the fire. Ed, Carol, and Sophia sat in a smaller circle around a smaller fire about a foot away. Rick was telling us how it felt when he woke up from the some he was in.
	“Disoriented. I guess that comes the closest. Disoriented. Fear, confusion, all those things, but disoriented comes closest.” He explained.
	“Words can be meager things. Sometimes they fall short.” Dale sighed. 
	“It felt like I was ripped out of my life and put somewhere else. For a while, I thought I was trapped in some coma dream. Something I might not wake up from, ever.” Rick continued.
	"Mom said you died.” Carl said, his voice almost a whisper. 
	“She had every reason to believe that. Don't you ever doubt it.” Rick reassured.
	“When things started to get really bad, they told me at the hospital, they were gonna medivac you and the other patients to Atlanta, and it never hapoened.” Lori added. 
	“Well, I'm not suprised. After Atlanta fell, from the looks of it, it got overrun.” Rick said. 
	“Yeah. Looks don't decieve. I barely got them out of there alive.” Shane commented. 
	“I can't tell you how grateful I am to you, Shane. I can't begin to express it.” Rick thanked. 
	It was silent for a moment and Dale spoke, “There go those words falling short again.”
	Ed put another log in his fire and Shane turned to him, “Ed, you wanna rethink that log?”
	“It's cold, man.” Ed complained. It was true. I was wrapped in a blanket and I was still freezing. 
	“Cold don't change the rules, now does it? We keep our fires low, just embers, so we can't be seen from a distance, right?” Shane asked. 
	“I said, it's cold. Why don't you mind your own business for once?” Ed shot back. Shane stood up and walked over. He removed the log and talked to Ed in a hushed tone. Afterwards, he made sure Carol and Sophia were okay. 
	Shane sat down again and it was silent for a few minutes. Dale turned to me, “Summer, what was it you were telling me about, yesterday, when I found you? You're looking for someone?” A couple people looked at me with questioning expressions. 
	“Yeah. I, uh, never really met him, I just know his name. Daryl Dixon.” I announced. 
	Everyone exchanged knowing glances, and Shane laughed, “He's actually hunting right now. He'll be back sometime tomorrow.”
	“Really? You actually know him?” I exclaimed. 
	“Yeah. Him and his brother, Merle, have been with us since the start.” Dale explained. I smiled, and the conversation shifted to Merle. Glenn and the others left him in Atlanta. It was highly possible he was dead. 
	We all went to bed shortly after. I slept a little better, but I still gripped my knife under my pillow. Batman snored, as usual. 
	When I woke up, Carl and Sophia were standing in front of my tent. “We've been waiting for you to wake up. We're gonna check out the forest. Maybe we can find something cool. Wanna join us?” Sophia requested. 
	I agreed and we started walking. After a couple minutes, we came face to face with a deer. A walker was eating chunks out of its neck. Carl and Sophia started yelling. I reached for my knife, but realized in horror that I left it on my bed. Everyone ran up to us and the guys started beating the walker. Dale eventually cut it's head off. A few branches snapped and a guy stepped out from behind a tree. He was holding a crossbow, “Son of a bitch! That's my deer! Look at it, all gnawwed on by this filthy, disease bearing, motherless, poxy, bastard!” He yelled, kicking the walker with each word. 
	“Calm down, son. That's not helping.” Dale reasoned.
	“What do you know about it, old man? Take your stupid hat and go back to On Golden Pond. I've been tracking this deer for miles. I was gonna drag it back to camp, cook us up some venison. What do you think? Think we can cut around this chewed up part?” He proposed. 
	“I would not risk it.” I advised.
	“Who the hell are you?” He snapped, stepping closer to me.
	“Daryl? Daryl Dixon?” I asked.
	“Yeah.” He agreed. 
	“I'm Summer. I'm your daughter.” I conceded.
