This repository was originally created for the [~~Zombie~~ Open Source Survival Guide](http://zombie-floss.herokuapp.com) talk I gave at [SeaGL](http://seagl.org/) on October 24, 2014. You are more than welcome to contribute, make suggestions or report issues. This is a safe place to practice pull requests, issue tracking and all things OPEN-SOURCEY.

If you've never contributed to anything on GitHub before, this is a great starter project. If you're completely at a loss for where to start, visit the accompanying site at http://zombie-floss.herokuapp.com.

Have fun, be kind and enjoy!
